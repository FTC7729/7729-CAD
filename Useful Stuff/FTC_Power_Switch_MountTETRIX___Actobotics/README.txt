# Summary

These switch mounts are made for the recommended TETRIX power switch, along side with the power switch on the power distribution module.

No more having to worry about your robot turning off mid game. It's big enough for a finger, but small enough to keep game elements and other robots from accidentally turning off your robot.

I also threw in a few other less popular versions of the Switch bracket, if they better fit your needs.

You can find the switch here: http://www.tetrixrobotics.com/TETRIX_RC_Switch_Kit

Check out the wiring diagram above, to see how to wire the switch.(click the X in the top corner of the image to view full image)

FTA's very much appreciate this switch mount, especially in RED and EASILY ACCESSIBLE.

Rule (RG04) requires that the power switch is easily accessible.  Because the power switch is built into the Core Power Distribution Module, module placement may become difficult or be situated in a vulnerable location. As a solution, FIRST recommends the use of an external TETRIX or MATRIX power switch.  Teams should be aware that TETRIX power switches come with blade connectors that are crimped onto tinned wire.  Over time this solder will creep (or flow), leading to a poor connection that may cause intermittent power interruptions. The simplest way to fix this problem is to cut off the tinned section of the wire and replace it with a new blade connector

Print in RED

Plastic: Any plastic you have that is strong enough to take an impact from another robot.

Supports are optional, I'm sure you know your printers limitations.

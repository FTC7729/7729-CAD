# Summary

This is a phone holder which I designed for my FIRST Tech Challenge robot. It is designed with two priorities in mind: USB support and the ability to hold the phone securely. 

The design allows the phone to snap in, being inserted into the top, and snapped in on the bottom, and provides optimal USB support on all sides

The USB support is designed to be used with a right angle phone plug (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/CableCreation-Degree-Micro-Adapter-Female/dp/B01LX00U5U) or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Sanoxy-Micro-Right-Angle-Adapter/dp/B005GI2VMG)), to be inserted, before the phone is snapped into the case

It can be printed in either ABS or PLA, and holds a Moto G4 play very securely, which can be useful if a steady phone mount is needed for Computer Vision tasks. 

This Phone holder was designed by FTC team Robocracy 9773. You can learn more about us on our website:  [www.ftcrobocracy.org](http://www.ftcrobocracy.org)

# Summary

These are battery holders that we have designed. Print whichever one you want. The slits on the bottom are for velcro zip-ties or anything like that.
--Actobotics_Battery_Holder.stl works for Actobotics and is ideal for a robot with higher walls
--TETRIX_Battery_holder_robot.stl is the same thing as the Actobotics one except with Tetrix holes on the bottom
--TETRIX_Battery_holder_charger.stl is a version which is slightly larger and has low walls which are good for use on a battery charger
--TETRIX_Battery_holder_charger_clip.stl is a slider that can fit on the charger battery holder where there is the slight indent. This could be good for indicating whether a battery is charged or not.
